                                                Object Rekognition & Billing
This project is to developed  information for detecting objects and calculating price and quantity, object name.
Object Recognition & Billing has an important role in image processing and Computer vision field. It is the process of determining the identity of an object being observed in an image from a set of known tags with the help of a recognition technique. Object recognition has many applications in the field of recognition, surveillance, industrial inspection, content based image retrieval(CBIR), robotics, medical analysis, human-computer interaction, intelligent vehicle systems etc. Object recognition becomes tedious due to the positioning, scaling, alignment and occlusion of objects. Indoor and outdoor images for same object can have varying lighting condition. Occlusion is the condition when an object is not fully visible in an image. An efficient object recognition method should be capable of handling such difficulties. The key objective is to develop object recognition  & Billing techniques which are efficient and less complex.
We use this application in many grocery supermarkets like Big Bazar. The billing personnel have to manipulate either the reader or the objects. This makes the task tedious for the human worker. Each object has to be scanned individually taking much time and making the task monotonous for the billing personnel especially in big stores where hundreds of customers
turn up in a day and thousands of objects have to be scanned in a day. In the modern era, the people have more income to spend and lesser time to spare, so they generally choose supermarkets for grocery and other shopping rather than local shops. Actually the customer is free to choose products from huge available varieties which attract the large customers mainly in big cities so long queues of customers are seen at these stores.  The advancements in technology have led to high speed computers with excellent processors and storage
capacity. The Object recognition & Billing can be used to develop an application for real time
automated billing to ease laborious human work. 
Thus this automated Object recognition and billing  system was thus developed and real time implementation was done for multiple objects. The recognition rate comes out to be 100% the customized database which is better than accuracy.


How to Detect Objects :
You can upload an image that you own or provide the URL to an image as input in the Amazon Rekognition console. Amazon Rekognition returns the object and scenes, confidence scores for each object, and scene it detects in the image you provide.
Note
The image must be less than 5MB in size and must be of JPEG or PNG format.
To detect objects and scenes in an image  provide
1.	Open the Amazon Rekognition console.
2.	Choose Object and scene detection.
3.	Do one of the following:
•	Upload an image – Choose Upload, go to the location where you stored your image, and then select the image.
•	Use a URL – Type the URL in the text box, and then choose Go.
4.	View the confidence score of each label detected in the Labels | Confidence pane.
